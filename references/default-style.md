# Default photobook style

Create a photographic art book with generous space, restrained typography, subtle material texture, and deliberate pacing.

Reuse the [HTML starter](../assets/html/index.html) and its [page styles, fonts, and textures](../assets/html/style/book-style.css) as the visual baseline.

- **Photographs dominate.** Preserve content, color, and proportions. Most words belong on the title page or in the colophon. Add captions and chapter text when the content or user calls for them.
- **Space and scale create rhythm.** Generous margins, smaller images, blank facing pages, and occasional denser pairings give pictures different amounts of attention. Choose relationships across spreads and page turns.
- **Typography stays modest.** Source Serif 4, sparse text, relaxed spacing, compatible serif fonts for other scripts, and no visible navigation bars by default.
- **Material stays subtle.** Lightly warm paper, fine grain beneath the images, muted cloth, and soft binding shadows.

Let the subject and user intent shape mood, title, cover color, format, and sequence. Preserve the visual hierarchy and restraint across subjects, while letting each collection determine its arrangement.

Fonts retain their included SIL Open Font License. See [runtime notes](book-editing.md) for page classes and integration.

The default presentation includes a warm overhead desk and a local page-turn sound. Keep the layered case, side paper blocks and closed-cover geometry supplied by `edition.css`. Replace background/audio through `book-config.js`; do not flatten the physical-book cues when changing the subject.
